#@ mail.rc
#@ Configuration file for Mail v14.9.6
#@ The syntax of this file is interpreted as follows:
#@ - Leading and trailing " \t\n" + *ifs* whitespace is removed.
#@ - Empty lines are ignored.
#@ - Any other line is a command line.  Such lines can be spread over
#@   multiple lines if the newline character is "escaped" by placing
#@   a reverse solidus character \ as the last character of the line; any
#@   leading whitespace of follow lines is ignored, trailing whitespace before
#@   the escaped newline is not.
#@ - The number sign # is the comment-command and causes the (joined) line
#@   (content) to be ignored.
#@ S-nail v14.9.6 / 2017-12-05

## Variables

# The standard POSIX 2008/Cor 2-2016 mandates the following initial settings:
# [a]   noallnet, noappend, asksub, noaskbcc, noaskcc, noautoprint,
# [b-e] nobang, nocmd, nocrt, nodebug, nodot, escape="~",
# [f-i] noflipr, nofolder, header, nohold, noignore, noignoreeof,
# [j-o] nokeep, nokeepsave, nometoo, nooutfolder,
# [p-r] nopage, prompt="? ", noquiet, norecord,
# [s]   save, nosendwait, noshowto, nosign, noSign,
# [t-z] toplines="5"
#
# Notes:
# - *hold, *keep*, *keepsave* and *sendwait* are deliberately set below.
# - no*onehop* doesn't exist in this implementation.
#   (To pass options through to the MTA, either add them after a "--"
#   separator on the command line or set the *mta-arguments* variable.)
# (Keep in SYNC: ./nail.h:okeys, ./nail.rc, ./nail.1:"Initial settings"!)
#
# Adjust the standard-imposed default variable settings.
# Some of the following variables are not portable and may thus have no effect
# with other Mail(1) / mailx(1) programs.
# Entries are marked [OPTION] if their availability is compile-time dependent.

# If threaded mode is activated, automatically collapse thread
set autocollapse

# Enter threaded mode automatically
#set autosort=thread

# Append rather than prepend when writing to mbox automatically.
# This has no effect unless *hold* is unset (it is set below), it is
# a compile-time setting for other cases.
# This is a traditional entry and should usually be set.
set append

# Ask for a message subject.
set ask

# Uncomment this in order to get coloured output in $PAGER (if possible).
#set colour-pager
# If your $PAGER is less(1) or lv(1) you will usually be served with
#  ? wysh set PAGER=less; environ unset LESS
#  ? wysh set PAGER=lv; environ unset LV

# Assume a CRT-like terminal and invoke a $PAGER if output doesn't fit on a
# the screen.  (Set crt=0 to always page; value treated as number of lines.)
set crt

# Startup into $EDITOR in compose mode ("automatic `~e'").
#set editalong

# When spawning an editor in compose mode (*editalong*, ~e), edit headers.
set editheaders

# Startup into interactive mode even if the (given) mailbox is empty.
set emptystart

# When `reply'ing etc. name parts and comments are stripped from receiver
# addresses unless this variable is set.
set fullnames

# [OPTION] Add more entries to the history as is done by default.
# The latter will cause the built-in editor to save those entries, too.
# (The *history-file* variable controls persistency of the history.)
set history-gabby history-gabby-persist

# Do not move read messages of system mailboxes to MBOX by default since this
# is likely to be irritating for most users today; also see *keepsave*.
set hold

# Quote the original message in replies by "> " as usual on the Internet.
# POSIX mandates tabulator ("wysh set indentprefix=$'\t'") as default.
set indentprefix="> "

# Mark messages that have been answered.
set markanswered

# Try to circumvent false or missing MIME Content-Type descriptions.
# Do set a value for extended behaviour (see the manual).
#set mime-counter-evidence
set mime-counter-evidence=0b1111

# Control loading of mime.types(5) file, "s"ystem and/or "u"ser, etc.
# Builtin types exist and may be sufficient.  The default equals "us".
#set mimetypes-load-control

# Do not remove empty (MBOX) system mailboxes.  (_No_ empty (MBOX) mailbox
# at all if $POSIXLY_CORRECT a.k.a. *posix* is set!)
# This may be relevant for privacy since other users could otherwise create
# them with different permissions.
set keep

# Do not move `save'd or `write'n message to $MBOX by default since this is
# likely to be irritating for most users today; also see *hold*.
set keepsave

# An informational prompt (and see "Gimmicks" below).
# Note the _real_ evaluation occurs once used (see *prompt* manual entry).
#wysh set prompt='?\$?!\$!/\$^ERRNAME[\${account-name}#\${mailbox-display}]? '

# Automatically quote the text of the message that is responded to.
set quote

# When replying, do not merge From: and To: of the original message
# into To:.  Instead old From: -> new To:, old To: -> merge Cc:.
set recipients-in-cc

# When responding to a message, try to answer in the same character set
# (which is subject to `charsetalias' expansion, though).
#set reply-in-same-charset

# [OPTION] Outgoing messages are sent in UTF-8 if possible, otherwise LATIN1.
# Note: it is highly advisable to read the section "Character sets" of the
# manual in order to understand all the possibilities that exist to fine-tune
# charset usage (variables also of interest: *ttycharset*, *charset-8bit*,
# *sendcharsets-else-ttycharset*; and of course we inherit the $LC_CTYPE /
# $LC_ALL / $LANG environment variables and react upon them).
set sendcharsets=utf-8,iso-8859-1

# When sending a message wait until the MTA (including the built-in SMTP one)
# exits before accepting further commands.  Only with this variable set errors
# reported by the MTA will be recognizable!
set sendwait

# Display real sender names in header summaries instead of only addresses.
set showname

# Show recipients of messages sent by the user himself in header summaries.
set showto

## Commands

# Most commands are not portable to other Mail(1) / mailx(1) programs, which is
# why most commands are commented out.  To remain portable, place anything
# specific in its own file, then "set mailx-extra-rc=~/.my-file" in $MAILRC
# (usually ~/.mailrc).

# Map ISO-8859-1 to LATIN1, and LATIN1 to CP1252.
# (These mappings are not applied to character sets specified by other
# variables, e.g., sendcharsets).
#charsetalias iso-8859-1 latin1  latin1 cp1252

# Only include the selected header fields when printing messages
# `headerpick' is not portable, so use the standard `retain'
retain from_ date from to cc subject message-id mail-followup-to reply-to
#headerpick type retain from_ date from to cc subject \
#   message-id mail-followup-to reply-to
# ...when forwarding messages
#headerpick forward retain subject date from to cc
# ...and don't include these when saving message, etc.
#if [ "$features" =@ +regex ]
#  headerpick save ignore '^Original-.*$' '^X-.*$'
#end

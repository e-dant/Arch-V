.SS "Description"
\fCcdh\fP with no arguments presents a list of recently visited directories\&. You can then select one of the entries by letter or number\&. You can also press [\fBtab\fP] to use the completion pager to select an item from the list\&. If you give it a single argument it is equivalent to \fCcd directory\fP\&.
.PP
Note that the \fCcd\fP command limits directory history to the 25 most recently visited directories\&. The history is stored in the \fC$dirprev\fP and \fC$dirnext\fP variables which this command manipulates\&. If you make those universal variables your \fCcd\fP history is shared among all fish instances\&.
.SS "See Also"
See also the \fC\fCprevd\fP\fP and \fC\fCpushd\fP\fP commands which also work with the recent \fCcd\fP history and are provided for compatibility with other shells\&.

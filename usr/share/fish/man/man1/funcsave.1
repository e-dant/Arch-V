.SS "Description"
\fCfuncsave\fP saves the current definition of a function to a file in the fish configuration directory\&. This function will be automatically loaded by current and future fish sessions\&. This can be useful if you have interactively created a new function and wish to save it for later use\&.
.PP
Note that because fish loads functions on-demand, saved functions will not function as \fCevent handlers\fP until they are run or sourced otherwise\&. To activate an event handler for every new shell, add the function to your \fCshell initialization file\fP instead of using \fCfuncsave\fP\&.

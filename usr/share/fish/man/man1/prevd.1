.SS "Description"
\fCprevd\fP moves backwards \fCPOS\fP positions in the history of visited directories; if the beginning of the history has been hit, a warning is printed\&.
.PP
If the \fC-l\fP or \fC--list\fP flag is specified, the current history is also displayed\&.
.PP
Note that the \fCcd\fP command limits directory history to the 25 most recently visited directories\&. The history is stored in the \fC$dirprev\fP and \fC$dirnext\fP variables which this command manipulates\&.
.PP
You may be interested in the \fC\fCcdh\fP\fP command which provides a more intuitive way to navigate to recently visited directories\&.

.SS "Description"
\fCand\fP is used to execute a command if the current exit status (as set by the previous command) is 0\&.
.PP
\fCand\fP statements may be used as part of the condition in an \fC\fCif\fP\fP or \fC\fCwhile\fP\fP block\&. See the documentation for \fC\fCif\fP\fP and \fC\fCwhile\fP\fP for examples\&.
.PP
\fCand\fP does not change the current exit status itself, but the command it runs most likely will\&. The exit status of the last foreground command to exit can always be accessed using the \fC$status\fP variable\&.
.SS "Example"
The following code runs the \fCmake\fP command to build a program\&. If the build succeeds, \fCmake\fP's exit status is 0, and the program is installed\&. If either step fails, the exit status is 1, and \fCmake clean\fP is run, which removes the files created by the build process\&.

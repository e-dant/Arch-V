.SS "Description"
\fCalias\fP is a simple wrapper for the \fCfunction\fP builtin, which creates a function wrapping a command\&. It has similar syntax to POSIX shell \fCalias\fP\&. For other uses, it is recommended to define a \fCfunction\fP\&.
.PP
\fCfish\fP marks functions that have been created by \fCalias\fP by including the command used to create them in the function description\&. You can list \fCalias\fP-created functions by running \fCalias\fP without arguments\&. They must be erased using \fCfunctions -e\fP\&.

\fCDEFINITION\fP is the actual command to execute\&. The string \fC$argv\fP will be appended\&.

You cannot create an alias to a function with the same name\&. Note that spaces need to be escaped in the call to \fCalias\fP just like at the command line, \fIeven inside quoted parts\fP\&.
.SS "Example"
The following code will create \fCrmi\fP, which runs \fCrm\fP with additional arguments on every invocation\&.

.PP
.nf

\fBalias\fP rmi='rm -i'
.fi
.PP
.PP
.PP
.nf
  This is equivalent to entering the following function:
\fBfunction\fP rmi --wraps rm --description 'alias rmi=rm -i'
    \fBrm\fP -i $argv
\fBend\fP
.fi

  This needs to have the spaces escaped or 'Chrome\&.app\&.\&.\&.' will be seen as an argument to '/Applications/Google':
\fBalias\fP chrome='/Applications/Google\\ Chrome\&.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome banana'

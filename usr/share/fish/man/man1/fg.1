.SS "Description"
\fCfg\fP brings the specified \fCjob\fP to the foreground, resuming it if it is stopped\&. While a foreground job is executed, fish is suspended\&. If no job is specified, the last job to be used is put in the foreground\&. If PID is specified, the job with the specified group ID is put in the foreground\&.
.PP
The PID of the desired process is usually found by using \fCprocess expansion\fP\&. Fish is capable of expanding far more than just the numeric PID, including referencing itself and finding PIDs by name\&.
.SS "Example"
\fCfg %1\fP will put the job with job ID 1 in the foreground\&.

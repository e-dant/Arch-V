.SS "Description"
\fCwhile\fP repeatedly executes \fCCONDITION\fP, and if the exit status is 0, then executes \fCCOMMANDS\fP\&.
.PP
If the exit status of \fCCONDITION\fP is non-zero on the first iteration, \fCCOMMANDS\fP will not be executed at all\&.
.PP
You can use \fC\fCand\fP\fP or \fC\fCor\fP\fP for complex conditions\&. Even more complex control can be achieved with \fCwhile true\fP containing a \fCbreak\fP\&.

\fBwhile\fP test -f foo\&.txt; \fBor\fP \fBtest\fP -f bar\&.txt ; \fBecho\fP file exists; \fBsleep\fP 10; \fBend\fP

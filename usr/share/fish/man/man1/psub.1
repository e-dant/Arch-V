.SS "Description"
Some shells (e\&.g\&., ksh, bash) feature a syntax that is a mix between command substitution and piping, called process substitution\&. It is used to send the output of a command into the calling command, much like command substitution, but with the difference that the output is not sent through commandline arguments but through a named pipe, with the filename of the named pipe sent as an argument to the calling program\&. \fCpsub\fP combined with a regular command substitution provides the same functionality\&.
.PP
The following options are available:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-f\fP or \fC--file\fP will cause psub to use a regular file instead of a named pipe to communicate with the calling process\&. This will cause \fCpsub\fP to be significantly slower when large amounts of data are involved, but has the advantage that the reading process can seek in the stream\&. This is the default\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-F\fP or \fC--fifo\fP will cause psub to use a named pipe rather than a file\&. You should only use this if the command produces no more than 8 KiB of output\&. The limit on the amount of data a FIFO can buffer varies with the OS but is typically 8 KiB, 16 KiB or 64 KiB\&. If you use this option and the command on the left of the psub pipeline produces more output a deadlock is likely to occur\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-s\fP or \fC--suffix\fP will append SUFFIX to the filename\&.
